TODO:
- Check for other paths that could open several collapsibles in the #talents page
- check that the old accordions are not causing issues with Bootstrap 5 and are just working by accident. We should port them to our new style as well.
- Talent popups should use the while screen in mobile mode, and be bigger in normal mode
- new  col xp penalty should use less decimals, and needs to be x100 to be actual percentage

Improve search list:
- Clear it more (after accepted solution)
- Highlight the first item
- On reactivate, directly update the search when you enter the textbox again

- Cannot link to DLC content source code, it is not available online


Item List:
- Identify list of common characteristics of items we want to display
- Identify item categories for subpages
- Count how many items we have per category
- (Check that the descriptions are not dependent on running functions to calculate values)
- Prepare full list of items in JSON with relevant features (skip dynamic content like functions)
- Prepare item icons
- Make a sample page for a single item
- Create subpages
- Read JSON and display information for all items

- Implement navigation
- Implement search
- Implement <View Source> by remembering line position in the cloned code
