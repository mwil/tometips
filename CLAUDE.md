- When you make edits to handlebars templates or partial, you need to run the handlebar tool. Check run.sh to see how to do it.

## Development Session - August 23, 2025

### UI/UX Improvements Completed:
1. **Fixed JavaScript Error**: Corrected `Handlebars.templates.class_talents_detail` to `Handlebars.partials.class_talents_detail` in classes.js and races.js

3. **Version Dropdown**: Added "Version: 1.7.6" dropdown to top navigation with consistent styling
4. **Layout Alignment**: Fixed alignment between "Stats", "Class Talents", and "Generic Talents" headings while maintaining side-by-side talent layout
5. **Margin Reduction**: Reduced excessive 20px margins throughout classes page for better visual density
